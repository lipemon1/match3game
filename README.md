# Challenge

Create a Match 3 Game like Candy Crush and similars with:

  - ✔ 8x8 board with 5 different animals
  - ✔ Player be able to swap horizontally and vertically 2 animals
  - ✔ If the swap result matches 3 or more animals, they are gone
  - ✔ If the swap has less than 2 animals, they must go back to original position
  - ✔ When player matches some animals, new animals must fill the board from the top
  - ✔ Player be able to swap dragging animals or just clicking on them
  
# Pop sfx and Shake

Sfx pop sound and shake, grows for every match with the number of animals on that match. In other words, if you make a match of 4 animals the shake and pop volume will be greater than a match of just 3 animals and so.
